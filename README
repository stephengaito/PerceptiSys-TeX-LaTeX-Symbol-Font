This is the PerceptiSys Symbols font project.

This project uses the FontForge project ( http://fontforge.sf.net ) to build
and maintain a Postscript Type 1 symbol font for the use of TeX/LaTeX (using
the TeXLive system).

The PerceptiSys Symbols font (what little there is of it) is copyright 
PerceptiSys Ltd but is licensed for reuse using a Creative Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License 
( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ ).

The scripts used to build and maintain this font in an TeX/LaTeX environment
are Copyright PerceptiSys Ltd and released under the LGPL license (see: 
www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html (currently at version 3.0)).

To alter this font you would make use of the excellent FontForge software
for your particular operating system. For an understanding of how to make such
modifications you must explore FontForge's documentation on your own.

To (re)build this font, in the base directory of this distribution, type:
  ./buildTeXFonts.rb

If there are no errors you can then install the fonts.

If this is a NEW installation you need to add a new font family as a single 
line in the $texLiveLocal/web2c/updmap-local.cfg file:
  Map fsyp.map

Then as root run
   tlmgr generate updmap
once.

For any installation you can then, as root or sudo, run:
  ./installFonts.sh


REQUIREMENTS:
  The fonts are authored using the FontForge software 
  The buildTeXFonts.rb script requires the ruby scripting language
  The installFonts.sh script requires the bash scripting language
  
  The whole system requires a modern installation of TeX/LaTex
    I use TeXLive ( http://www.tug.org/texlive/ )
